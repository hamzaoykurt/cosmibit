# Project Brief - CosmiBit

## Project Overview
CosmiBit is a high-end corporate and portfolio website built with a modern decoupled (headless) architecture. The project emphasizes visual richness through advanced 3D rendering, glassmorphism design, and fluid animations to deliver a premium user experience.

## Core Goals
1. **Premium Visual Experience**: Create a visually stunning website with 3D elements and glassmorphism effects
2. **Decoupled Architecture**: Maintain complete separation between frontend and backend for flexibility and scalability
3. **Modern Tech Stack**: Use cutting-edge technologies (React, Spring Boot, MongoDB, Three.js)
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure seamless experience across all devices
5. **Portfolio Showcase**: Effectively display projects, services, and team information

## Project Type
- Corporate website
- Portfolio showcase
- Informational platform with contact capabilities

## Target Audience
- Potential clients looking for development services
- Partners interested in collaboration
- Visitors exploring company capabilities

## Key Features
1. **3D Visual Effects**
   - Interactive ambient background with particles
   - Liquid glass sphere with distortion effects
   - 3D project gallery with circular card layout

2. **Glassmorphism UI**
   - Frosted glass effects throughout the interface
   - Transparent, blurred backgrounds
   - Modern, elegant aesthetic

3. **Content Management**
   - Projects showcase (completed, in-progress, upcoming)
   - Team member profiles
   - Services listing
   - Contact form with backend integration

4. **Smooth Animations**
   - Page transitions using Framer Motion
   - Hover effects on interactive elements
   - Floating and glowing animations

## Project Constraints
- Must maintain clean separation between frontend and backend
- Backend must be RESTful and API-first
- Frontend must support WebGL for 3D features
- Cross-browser compatibility required
- Mobile-responsive design mandatory

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Interactive 3D elements rendering smoothly
- ✅ All CRUD operations working via REST API
- ✅ Responsive design across devices
- ✅ Premium visual aesthetic achieved
- Contact form successfully submitting to backend
- Production-ready deployment configuration

## Technical Foundation
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.2.0 with MongoDB
- **Frontend**: React 18 with Vite
- **3D Rendering**: React Three Fiber + Three.js
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom glassmorphism utilities
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
